# Defensive Security: Designing a Custom Monitoring Environment

## Overview
This week, you will work in groups to use the skills that you've learned in the Defensive Security unit and design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization, VSI. 

## Project Breakdown

### Day 1: Research & Design
- Use **Splunk** to research and design a monitoring solution for VSI.
- Identify key security events, logs, and alerts necessary to protect the organization.
### Day 2: Testing & Evaluation
- Determine whether the designed monitoring solution is effective in detecting and mitigating several simulated attacks.
- Adjust configurations and refine monitoring rules based on the test results.
### Day 3: Presentation
- Showcase your defensive security project with a group presentation to the class.
- Explain the monitoring solution, its effectiveness, and any improvements made based on testing.

# Day 1 - Defensive Security: Designing a Custom Monitoring Environment 

## Overview
Today, you will work with your group to develop a defensive solution in order to protect the mock organization. You will receive logs of “normal” business functions in order to understand the organization's environment. You will use these logs to create baselines and then design custom alerts, reports, and dashboards. You will additionally have the opportunity to download and use a Splunk "add-on" app of your choice to monitor against a type of attack.

## What You’ll Learn
By the end of today's class, you will:
- Load and analyze Windows logs.
- Create reports, alerts, and dashboards for the Windows logs.
- Load and analyze Apache logs.
- Create reports, alerts, and dashboards for the Apache logs.
- Install an add-on Splunk application for additional monitoring.

# Day 2 - Defensive Security: Evaluating Monitoring Solutions

## Overview
Today, you will work with your group to determine whether the monitoring solutions that you designed on Day 1 protected VSI against attacks from its adversary, JobeCorp. Additionally, you will create a short presentation showcasing the work that you completed on Days 1 and 2, which you'll present to the class on Day 3.

## What You’ll Learn
By the end of today's class, you will:
- Load Windows attack logs.
- Analyze Windows attack logs.
- Load Apache attack logs.
- Analyze Apache attack logs.
- Create project presentations.
